Initial steps

1. To setup Angular App in terminal inside angular-chart-app directory type "npm i", this will create node_modulea (that will be useful for the whole project to handle the libraries).

2. To setup backend App do the same type terminal inside backend directory "npm i", this will create node_modulea for backend libs.

3. After setting up both the projects, start the server of backend by typing "npm start".

4. When backend server is ready to serve, we need to open angular app in the default browser by typing "ng serve --open" (it will open app in the browser and fetch data from the backend).

5. That's it.
